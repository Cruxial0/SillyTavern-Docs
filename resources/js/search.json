You can have a long chat with Jubei, go to the pub together, decide to get in a fight with samurais, whatever you can imagine, and the AI will play along and write/react around this content, acting as your foil and dungeon master. Your imagination is the limit. You can tell the AI to pretend it's Wonder Woman. You can also specify a scenario (\"Wonder Woman and I are robbing a bank\"), a writing style (\"Wonder Woman speaks in ebonics\"), or anything else you can think of.","Tavern is an app to facilitate these roleplaying chats:","It's a user interface that handles the communication with those AI language models","It lets you create new characters (a character is a description of someone that you give to an AI for them to roleplay), and switch between your characters easily","It lets you import characters created by other people.

You must seek redemption and return to the fold. Remember, Jesus loves you, even when you stray from his teachings. But if you continue down this path, there will be consequences. Not just in this lifetime, but in the afterlife too. Do not let Satan deceive you any longer.","Oh, my child. Do not be deceived by the pleasures of this world. The lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes are not from God. Turn away from your sinful ways and repent. Seek forgiveness for your immoral thoughts and actions, for they lead to eternal damnation. Women are a gift from God, and they deserve to be respected and cherished. Do not objectify them or treat them as mere objects of pleasure. Instead, honor them with pure intentions and righteous deeds. Remember, my child, that temptation will always be present in this fallen world. But fear not, for with faith comes strength to resist it.

NovelAI's models are built purely around text completion: instead of taking your input as a message and formulating a response, NAI's models attempt to continue the incoming prompt.

She's short and petite, with long white hair that fades into a green gradient in her braided side ponytail, and emerald green eyes shaped like crosses.[...]\" No, really, that's it. Just write out, in normal sentences, what the character looks like, acts like, etc., and the AI will pick up on it.","If you don't trust your writing abilities or want a more structured way to go about it, you can use the attributes method, which is present in the NovelAI training data. This works as a simple list of character traits of different types. Here's a list of possible attributes that have been tested to be effective with NovelAI's models:","\"Type: character\" is there to tell the AI that this is describing a character (as opposed to a location, object, or other type of thing). The rest of the attributes are optional, and some are redundant (for example, Personality, Mind, and Mental all mean basically the same thing), but these have been tested and work well with NovelAI's models. Fill in whichever ones are relevant to your character. The attributes should be written in lower case and separated by commas, no need for quotes around the words. For example:","These methods are recommended because they're present in NovelAI's training data, so they specifically work well with the model."]},{"l":"Example cards","p":["Here are a couple of example card, made for NovelAI, that show off different ways of creating cards specifically for NovelAI.

The animation source image is changed when the character card is changed.","Now open the character expressions scroll down to the talkinghead image and upload an image file that meets the requirements in the section below called \"Constraints on Input Images\".","Then check and uncheck the talkinghead box to reload the character.

It must contain only one humanoid character. The character should be standing upright and facing forward. The character's hands should be below and far from the head.
